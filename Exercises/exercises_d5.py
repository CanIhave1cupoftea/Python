#Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer. Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1.

#my answer
def binary_array_to_number(arr):
  # your code
    arr.reverse()
    binary = []
    for i, j in enumerate(arr):
        if j == 1:
            binary.append(j * 2**i)
    
    return (sum(binary))


#clever answer
def binary_array_to_number(arr):
    return int(''.join(str(a) for a in arr), 2)

#The number 81 has a special property, a certain power of the sum of its digits is equal to 81 (nine squared). Eighty one (81), is the first number in having this property (not considering numbers of one digit). The next one, is 512. Let's see both cases with the details
